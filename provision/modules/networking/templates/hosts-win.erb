# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
# 127.0.0.1       localhost
# ::1             localhost
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       <%= @fqdn %>

172.16.32.10 puppet.<%= @domain %> puppet
172.16.32.11 client1.<%= @domain %> client1
172.16.32.12 client2.<%= @domain %> client2

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
# ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
# fe00::0 ip6-localnet
# ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
# ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
# ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
